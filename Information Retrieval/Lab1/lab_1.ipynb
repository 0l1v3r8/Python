    "This labsheet is designed to help recap your Python knowledge from basic programming through to functions. While working on this labsheet you will get a practical refresher in writing python code. All content in this labsheet is covered in the week 1 lecture, so please have the lecture slides open to go through in parallel. If you need any help, advice, or if you have general questions about coding in Python please chat to us in the lab!"

    "1.\tSimple Message: Assign a message to a variable, and then print that message.\n",
    "2.\tSimple Messages: Assign a message to a variable and print that message. Then change the value of variable to a new message and print the new message.\n",
    "3.\tPersonal Message: Using a variable to represent a person’s name, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Aaron, would you like to learn some Python today?” F strings may help you here - look here for more information: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html\n",
    "4.\tName Cases: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.\n",
    "5.\tFamous Quote: Find a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of it’s author. For example. \n",
    " Donald Knuth once said: “Premature optimisation is the root of all evil”\n",
    "6.\tRepeat exercise 5, but this this time represent the famous person’s name using a variable called famous_person. The compose your message and present it with new a variable called message."

    "2.\tGreetings: Start with the list used in 1, but instead of just printing there name, print a message to them instead. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name. Again, using F strings will really help here.\n",
    "3.\tDays in a month: Different months have a different number of days in them. Create separate lists which contain the collection of months with the same number of days. Write a if-elif-else chain to print the correct number of days based on a given month.\n",
    "4.\tGuest List:  If you could invite anyone to dinner, living or deceased, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people who you would like to invite, and then print a message inviting them. \n",

    "    1.\tStart with your programming from 4 and 5. Add print at the end informing your guests that you’ve found a bigger table\n",

    "    4.\tUse append() to add one new guest to the end of your list\n",
    "    5.\tPrint a new set of invitations for each person in your list.\n",
    "7.\tShrinking Guest List: You found out your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for dinner, and you only have space for two guests.\n",
    "a.\tStart with your program from 6. Add a new line that prints a message saying you can only invite two guests now.\n",
    "b.\tUse pop() to remove guests from your list on at a time until only two names remain. Each time you pop a name, print a message saying you’re sorry you can’t invite them.\n",
    "c.\tPrint a message to each of the two people still on your list letting them know, they are still invited. \n",
    "d.\tUse del to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.\n"

    "3.\tMultiple of Two: Ask the user for a number, and then report whether the number is a multiple of 2 or not.\n",
    "4.\tCinema Tickets: A cinema charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age. If a person is under the age of 5, the ticket is free. If a person is between 5 and 12 the ticket is £3, if they are over 12 and under 65 the ticket is £10 and if they are over 65 the ticket is £5.

    "    1.\t Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.\n",
    "    2.\t Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.\n",
    "    3.\t Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.\n",
